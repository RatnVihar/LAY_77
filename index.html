                      8.13 We offer fair, open and transparent progressive
                      jackpots on specific games for players who use its
                      services for entertainment purposes only. In cases where
                      We suspect that a game’s or promotion’s intended spirit is
                      abused, We reserve the right to suspend, or cancel
                      entirely, Your access to the game in question. Should We
                      find it necessary, We may also close Your Account with
                      immediate effect. Where Your Account has been terminated,
                      We shall not be liable for any losses up to the point the
                      Account was closed, nor will We consider any refunds on
                      balances remaining on the Account. ‘Abuse’ is defined as,
                      but not limited to, software-aided play on multiple games
                      concurrently to generate more rounds of a game that could
                      not be done naturally by a human player playing alone.
                      Also, the practice of ‘cherry-picking’ games with ‘value’
                      jackpots, to the rank exclusion of all other games, will
                      be considered an abuse of the spirit in which the jackpot
                      is intended. In all cases where abuse has been proven
                      beyond a reasonable doubt, We retain the right to
                      confiscate all of the winnings and any balance remaining
                      on the Account.

                      both “My Account” and “Deposit” pages of the Site. The
                      payment methods made available to You may change. Some
                      payment methods may not be available in all countries.

                      descriptor for all Bank Card payments will show up as it's
                      own website. It is unlawful to deposit money which has
                      been obtained illegally. We accept payments made in EUR,

                      one currency as the currency of Your Account. Any payments
                      received in a currency other than the one chosen by you
                      will be converted into the currency of Your Account at the
                      exchange rate We choose. Also, any exchange premiums are
                      payable by you. When payment is made using a credit card,
                      We may request a certified copy of that credit card (front
                      and back). Please ensure that only the first 6 digits and
                      the last 4 digits of the card are visible and that the CVV
                      /CVV2 number on the back of the card is also not visible.

                      9.2 Payouts When the outcome of a Game You take part in is
                      determined, or when We confirm the result of an event, any
                      winnings will be made available to you on Your Account. If
                      We mistakenly credit Your Account with winnings that do
                      not belong to You for any reason, these will be taken back
                      from Your Account. If You have withdrawn these winnings
                      before We become aware of this error, You must immediately
                      inform Us and will be required to pay this back. If You do
                      not We will take all legal action available to us to
                      recover this debt.

                      9.3 Withdrawals You may withdraw any amount up to the
                      “Available to Bet” balance in Your Account by issuing a
                      valid notice of withdrawal. Notices for withdrawals must
                      be made on the Site only. If You want to withdraw all Your
                      funds, You must first cancel any outstanding stakes. You
                      agree that funds in Your Account must only be used for
                      playing the Games found on the Site. If You request a
                      withdrawal without turning over an amount that is equal or
                      more than the amount deposited, We reserve the right to
                      enforce a turnover of the full or part of the previous
                      deposit(s) made and/or charge a fee on the withdrawal
                      requested. We can reject a withdrawal request if We
                      suspect that funds are being withdrawn for any fraudulent
                      or money laundering reasons. Prior to accepting a
                      withdrawal, We may request that You provide legal
                      identification, for example certified copies of passports,
                      ID cards or other such documentation as We feel is
                      required in the circumstances. We may also carry out phone
                      verification, face verification or other such verification
                      as is required to ensure that You are who You say You are.
                      If You withdraw an amount which cumulatively exceed EUR
                      2,000 (or the equivalent in Your Account currency) We will
                      carry out additional verification procedures. We may also
                      carry out these verification procedures even in the case
                      of lower withdrawals. Where a withdrawal is to be made
                      using a credit card, We may request a certified copy of

                      through the same payment method chosen by You when placing
                      a deposit, unless We decide otherwise or are unable to do
                      so. If You deposit using a number of payment methods, We
                      reserve the right to split Your withdrawal across such
                      payment methods and process each part through the
                      respective payment method at Our discretion and in
                      accordance with anti-money laundering policies and
                      regulations. The time for a withdrawal request to be
                      finalised may vary due to circumstances, however a
                      withdrawal attempt should be approved or denied within
                      three (3) business days. When a withdrawal is cancelled,
                      the funds are returned back to your account and you can
                      make use of those funds accordingly on the account.

                      lost during gameplay following a withdrawal cancellation
                      either by you or by us. All winnings of 20,000 EUR or more
                      (excluding progressive jackpot wins), we reserve the right
                      to divide the payout into ten installments, paid with 10
                      per cent of the winning sum every month until the full
                      amount is paid out. It is at the players discretion to
                      request a withdrawal every month until the funds are
                      entirely paid out. We may request that You redirect Your
                      withdrawal or cancel it or request that it is redirected
                      to a different method of withdrawal in accordance with
                      anti-money laundering polices and/or regulations.
                      Cancellation of a withdrawal (whether this was made by You
                      or Us) does not entitle You to any compensation should You
                      choose to play with the funds in Your Account before any
                      withdrawal is completed. We reserve the right to charge an
                      administrative fee in the event that You proceed with more
                      than 30 approved withdrawals/payout requests during one
                      (1) calendar month. The administrative fee shall be 2% of
                      the transaction value but no less than EUR 5. It shall be
                      charged on each withdrawal following the 30th withdrawal
                      within each given month.

                      return to Our lobby. You can deactivate the Reality Check
                      at any time by opting-out on the pop up. If You would like

                        a self-exclusion period, the invitation is automatically
                        withdrawn upon self-exclusion) . This is to prevent

                      28.1 Game Specific Rules The Rules included in this
                      section relate to specific Games. We sometimes use Games
                      provided by other companies and they ask us to include
                      these rules in our own Rules. There are sometimes Rules
                      which are so specific to a Game, you only need to be aware
                      of those Rules if you play that Game. All of these rules
                      have been dropped in this section. By playing any of the
                      Games you will be agreeing to these Game Rules.
